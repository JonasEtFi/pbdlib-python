### Installation

This requires v2.7 of Python.

Following these instructions install the library without copying the files, allowing to edit the sources files without reinstalling.

    git clone https://gitlab.idiap.ch/rli/pbdlib-python.git
    cd pbdlib-python
    pip install -e .

If pip is not install, you can get it that way:

    sudo apt-get install python-pip
